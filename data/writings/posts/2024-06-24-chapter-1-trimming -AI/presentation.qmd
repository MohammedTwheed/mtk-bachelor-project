## Project Overview

### What is this project all about?
This project aims to optimize the trimming of pump impeller diameters using neural networks. 

It compares the performance of neural networks with traditional trimming methods in predicting the correct diameter for efficient pump operation.



## Project Goals

- build code that is capable of search for optimal neural network architecture using genetic algorithms (using matlab `ga`).
- compare NNs with traditional scaling based methods as in *weme paper*

## How will it achieve its goals?
- Train neural networks on existing pump performance data.
- create loop to hide a one curve and use it for testing in addition to the beps.
- Evaluate the trained models on new data points (beps) with best efficiency points used for testing performance of NNs we build.
- Compare the neural network predictions to traditional trimming methods.

## Tools Used

## Tools it will use
- MATLAB ga toolbox.
- MATLAB Neural Network Toolbox in MATLAB.
- Traditional trimming methods: Constant Area Scaling (*weme paper*) and nearest diameter method (this our convention of largest diameter being the master).

##  Neural Networks - Theory

## Neural Networks Explained
- Neural networks are composed of layers of interconnected nodes.
- Each node applies a weighted sum followed by a non-linear activation function.
- The network is trained using a dataset to minimize the error in predictions.

## Example
1. **Input Layer**: Receives input data (e.g., flow rate, head).
2. **Hidden Layers**: Perform transformations on the data.
3. **Output Layer**: Produces the prediction (e.g., trimmed diameter).
4. **Epochs**: number of iterations.

##  Traditional Trimming Methods - Theory

### Constant Area Scaling
- Adjusts the impeller diameter while maintaining a constant area ratio.
- Traditional method used for scaling pump performance.

### Nearest Diameter Method
- Chooses the nearest available diameter from a predefined set based on performance criteria.

##  Neural Network Performance

## Performance of the Neural Networks
- Training and testing neural networks with various architectures.
- Evaluating on metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE).
- Results show how well the network predicts the trimmed diameters.


##  Traditional Methods Performance

## Performance of Traditional Trimming Methods
- Comparison with Constant Area Scaling and nearest diameter method.
- Errors are calculated as the difference between the predicted and actual diameters.
