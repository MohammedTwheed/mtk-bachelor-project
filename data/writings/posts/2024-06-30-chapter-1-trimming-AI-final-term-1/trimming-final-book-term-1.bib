  abstract = {The effect of trimming of radial impellers on the hydraulic performance of low specific-speed centrifugal pumps is studied. Prediction methods from literature, together with a new prediction method that is based on the simplified description of the flow field in the impeller, are used to quantify the effect of trimming on the hydraulic performance. The predictions by these methods are compared to measured effects of trimming on the hydraulic performance for an extensive set of pumps for flow rates in the range of 80\% to 110\% of the best efficiency point. Of the considered methods, the new prediction method is more accurate (even for a large impeller trim of 12\%) than the considered methods from literature. The new method generally overestimates the reduction in the pump head after trimming, and hence results less often in impeller trims that are too large when the method is used to determine the amount of trimming that is necessary in order to attain a specified head.},

This leads to avoid high pressure losses across a control valve throttled to reduce flow. It also improves the gross efficiency of pumping units and results in energy saving.},

  abstract = {In the present investigation, the fluid dynamic characteristics of a narrow channel centrifugal pump are studied using numerical simulations with special emphasis on pump trimming operations. The trimming operations at optimized rate, reduce the pressure fluctuations and hydraulic noise in pumps, but at the cost of pump perfor­ mance characteristics. This has been extensively studied by the researchers in the past; however, the efficacy of trimming operations on industrial pumps with narrow channel passage impellers is to be explored. A low specific speed pump with narrow channel impeller passage and radial discharge volute (M1) with specific speed of 14.7 is considered for the present investigation. Detached Eddy Simulation (DES) is used in transient simulations and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is used to understand the pressure fluctuations and hydraulic noise at the Blade Pass Frequency (BPF) and its harmonics. The pressure fluctuation behavior along the impeller periphery is monitored at 30 equidistant probes and 7 probes covering the volute tongue. These results are compared with the similar study for impeller with oblique trimming of 30◦ (M2) and impeller oblique trimming along with volute trimming (M3). The flow behavior in M1 is dominated by a Jet-wake flow in the impeller passage which acts as a primary source of flow non-uniformity. The resulting non-uniform flow on the impeller periphery interacting with the volute tongue causes vortex shedding behind the volute tongue, subsequently leading to discharge recirculation in the impeller. The coefficient of pressure fluctuations near volute tongue at BPF is reduced by 10.3\% in M2, whereas it is enhanced by 24\% in M3 relative to M1. The enhanced vortex shedding behind the volute tongue in addition to the vortex train along the impeller periphery causes rise of the pressure fluctuations in M3.},

  abstract = {We introduce Adam, an algorithm for first-order gradient-based optimization of stochastic objective functions, based on adaptive estimates of lower-order moments. The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

  abstract = {Impeller trimming can improve the hydrodynamic performances of the centrifugal pump and expand the application range of the pumps. However, most researches focus on single-impeller cutting method; the literature slightly lacks a comparison of the different impeller trimming methods, which is very important in deciding on an impeller trimming method. In this paper, by taking the centrifugal pump as the research object, the accuracy of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) was verified by comparing experimental results and those of the numerical simulation. On the basis of impeller straight trimming, miscut, and triangle trimming methods, a new unconventional parabolic impeller trimming method was put forward. In different trimming sizes and operating conditions, performance curves of four impeller trimming methods were compared to get several different trimming models. By researching the flow field of centrifugal pump, the change reasons of centrifugal pump’s performance curves were further revealed. The turbulent kinetic energy distribution and pressure distribution of the four trimming methods at best efficiency points (BEPs) were compared. The results showed that impeller trimming can improve pressure distribution of the impeller outlet, decrease shaft power, and increase energy saving.
