Impeller trimming, a process involving modifications to pump impeller geometry, traditionally requires expert knowledge and empirical methods to achieve the desired performance. The use of neural networks (NN) provides an automated approach to improve the impeller trimming process based on input data and performance outcomes. The proposed method uses a (GA) to identify the optimal NN hyperparameters, such as hidden layer size, training function, activation function, and maximum epochs, aiming to minimize the mean squared error (MSE) between the network’s predictions and the actual target outcomes. This paper discusses the implementation details of the optimization process and explains the key components and their significance. \n\n\n\n\n\nApr 15, 2024\n\n\nMohamed Farid Khalil, Mohammed Twheed Khater, Seif Ibrahim Hassan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"

    "text": "Pump impeller trimming is a critical procedure in optimizing pump performance for specific applications. It involves modifying the impeller’s geometry to achieve desired hydraulic characteristics such as head, flow rate, and efficiency. Traditionally, the process has been dependent on empirical methods and engineering expertise. However, the introduction of artificial neural networks (NN) offers a data-driven approach to automate and enhance impeller trimming.\nNN excel at modeling complex relationships between input data and desired outputs.\nBy training an NN on a dataset of impeller designs and performance outcomes, the network can learn to predict new impeller performance based on their geometries.\nIn the case of pump impeller trimming, the input data in our case is the desired operating point of the pump (flow rate Q, head H), while the target data or output from the network is (the impeller outer diameter D , pump efficiency \\(\\eta\\) ).\nAchieving optimal NN performance requires selecting appropriate hyperparameters, which influence network architecture and the learning process. Key NN hyperparameters include : 1. the size of the hidden layer. 2. the training function for weight updates. 3. the activation function introducing non-linearity. 4. the maximum number of training epochs."

This is because neural network training algorithms typically rely on gradient descent to optimize weights. By normalizing the input data to a specific range (often -1 to 1 or 0 to 1), the gradients calculated during backpropagation have a more consistent magnitude. This helps the training process converge faster and avoid getting stuck in local minima.\nwe set a random seed for reproducibility where Setting a random seed ensures that the neural network training process is reproducible. This allows for consistent results across different runs and helps in comparing models fairly."
