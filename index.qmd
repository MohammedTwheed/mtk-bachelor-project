## Beyond Trial and Error: A Machine Learning Approach to Optimal Centrifugal Pump Impeller Trimming


This paper proposes a novel method for optimizing pump impeller trimming using machine learning. Traditionally, this process relies on expertise and can be time-consuming. The proposed approach utilizes artificial neural networks (NNs) to predict impeller diameter and pump power based on desired operating conditions. A genetic algorithm (GA) then optimizes the NN for accurate predictions, leading to potentially faster and more efficient pump impeller trimming.
